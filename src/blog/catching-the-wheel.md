# Catching the Wheel at REI
One of my proudest moments as an engineer was when I helped bring to light a severe web performance issue in REI's A/B testing implementation. This effort took an incalcuable amount of team work. It wouldn't have been possible without the immense engineering talent at REI. 

Performance improvements are usually measured in miliseconds, not seconds. After addressing the issue, REI saw 50%-60% improvements to Largest Contentful Paint and First Contentful Paint performance metrics. This knocked down a massive wall in REI's web architecture that allowed for many following optimizations.
