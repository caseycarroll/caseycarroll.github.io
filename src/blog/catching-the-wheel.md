# Catching the Wheel at REI
REI was a special place with immense engineering talent. When I first identified an issue with REI's A/B testing solution, I was nervous. A/B testing is absolutely critical to running an e-commerce site, and it was imperitive to change how we used it. Fortunately I had the support and expertise from REI's engineers to help build my case and offer a better solution. 

After addressing this issue, REI saw 50%-60% improvements to Largest Contentful Paint and First Contentful Paint performance metrics. This was my most significant accomplishment at REI.
